# About me:
I am an Assistant Research Scientist at Johns Hopkins University. I develop advanced computational and simulation technologies to enhance surgeons’ situational awareness, optimize clinical workflows, and improve patient outcomes. Central to this work is the Asynchronous Multi-Body Framework (AMBF), an open-source, real-time simulation platform I created and lead. AMBF supports high-fidelity physics, haptics, and robot control, and has been integrated with a wide range of imaging modalities (CT, MRI), tool registration methods, tracking systems (optical and electromagnetic), and robotic interfaces—including Galen, UR5, KUKA, da Vinci, Steady Hand Eye Robot (SHER), and Integrated Intraocular Snake (IRIS). In collaboration with clinicians and researchers, I apply this framework across diverse surgical domains—otolaryngology (lateral skull base, endonasal), spinal surgery (laminectomy), ophthalmology (epiretinal membrane peeling, deep vein cannulation), gynecology (hysterectomy), and orthopedics (drilling, implant placement)
